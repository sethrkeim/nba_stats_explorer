# nba_stats_explorer


This shiny app is dedicated to providing National Basketball Association Statistics on every player that has played in the league. Each tab has a graph that allows you to choose which variables to plot. The first graph shows statistics per game for each player that you select. This graph allows comparison of players' performance in these stats over time. The second graph shows career total statistics for players. The third graph shows the players' rank in the league for specific per game stats each year. This allows comparison of the dominance of players in their respective leagues. The fourth graph shows physical attributes and stats. It plots a linear model to find a relationship between the variable. For example, taller players typically have more blocks. The final chart is not interactive, but instead it is an animation of the cumulative scoring of the top 8 total scorers of all time in the NBA. One of the biggest debates in the NBA has been: 'Who is the Greatest of All Time (GOAT)? There may not be a definitive answer, but check out these charts to see if you can come to your own conclusion.
